### 🧠 About Me

I'm a data analyst who values structured thinking, clarity, and communication in analytics.  
My work focuses on transforming raw datasets into interpretable insights using a full-cycle workflow:

- ✨ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) grounded in domain context  
- 🧼 Data preprocessing: binning, normalization, discretization, binarization  
- 🔍 Unsupervised learning using KMeans clustering for pattern discovery  
- 📊 Visual storytelling with Python and Seaborn/Matplotlib  
- 📁 Modular pipeline design using notebooks and Python scripts

> I believe good data work isn't just code — it's **insight, logic, and explanation**.
